# Todo app - Client

This is a repository for the client side of the todo app, which was built in React. This application uses private routes to handle authentication, in association with the backend server.

Basically, the pages that compose the website are Login, Signup and MainPage, the last one being the one that requires authentication to be accessed. In the future, it is planned to add others, including a home page to show an overview of the hole website.
